# NCSR-Based-Cybersecurity-Maturity-Assessment
This project is an indepenedent cybersecurity maturity assessment based on the National Cybersecuirty Review (NCSR), a voluntary annual survey aligned with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). This assessment evaluates the cybersecurity posture of the University of Califronia System across the five (5) NIST CSF v1.1 Functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

The NCSR's 108 questions are mapped to NIST CSF categories and subcategories, making it a structered way to evaluate governance, technical controls, risk management practices, operational maturity, and resilience. 

This project is still a work in progress, and I will continue expanding the analysis and visualizations. So far, it has been an excellent hands-on learning experience, especially in:
- Understanding of NIST CSF Functions (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Governance as well for v2.0)
- Evidence collection and mapping to security controls
- Crosswalking security controls to authoritative sources (policy-to-control mapping)
- Control scoring and maturity analysis  
- Data visualization 
- Open-source intelligence (OSINT) research  
- Evaluating an organization’s policies and procedures against a security framework  
- Assessing security control effectiveness and identifying improvement opportunities  
- Critical thinking and analytical problem-solving in a real-world context
